#DESCRIPTION : This is a console-based Snake Game implemented in C++ for Windows. The game allows the player to control a snake using keyboard inputs (W, A, S, D) to navigate around the grid. The objective is to 
               eat the fruit (F) and grow in size while avoiding collisions with the snake's own body.
    How the Game Works :
                      # The snake (X) moves in a 20x20 grid.
                      # The fruit (F) spawns at a random location.
                      # When the snake eats the fruit:
                      # The score increases by 10 points.
                      # The snake grows in length.
                      # If the snake collides with itself, the game ends.
                      # The game allows the snake to wrap around the screen instead of hitting the walls.
